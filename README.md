# Spirit Woods (WIP)

## Spirit Woods

* Spirit Woods is a raid event in Guild Wars 2. I'm making this event with some roguelike elements.
* The purpose of this project is to learn and practice using the zenject framework. 

 *There may be misuse in the use of zenject in some places. I'm still in the learning phase.*

## Gameplay

There are Spectral Rifts will begin to spawn randomly in fixed locations. Player have to stand inside of the Spectral Rifts for a period of time to close them. Progress bars for each rift, as well as the overall progress on the encounter, can be seen in the upper right hand portion of the screen. Meanwhile, a random number and type of enemies will spawn and take action against the Player.

## What is Zenject?

Zenject is a lightweight dependency injection framework built specifically to target Unity 3D (however it can be used outside of Unity as well). It can be used to turn your application into a collection of loosely-coupled parts with highly segmented responsibilities. Zenject can then glue the parts together in many different configurations to allow you to easily write, re-use, refactor and test your code in a scalable and extremely flexible way.
